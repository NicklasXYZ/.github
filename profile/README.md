The gleam-community organisation was set up to provide **high-quality**,
**authoritative** packages for the wider Gleam community to use. These packages
are typically beyond the scope of – or not a good fit for – the core Gleam
organisation, but would still benefit from having a single high-quality
implementation.

While we may have different maintainers for each project, you can always reach
out to the [organisation's admins](https://github.com/gleam-community/META/blob/main/ADMINS.md).

## What kind of packages are maintained by gleam-community?

As we are **not** affiliated with the core Gleam organisation, we are free to
maintain whatever packages we think might be useful. With that in mind, we have
a few guidelines for what constitutes a good fit for the organisation:

- Does the package have broad appeal to the Gleam community? Is it useful in most,
  if not **all**, Gleam targets: BEAM, Node.js, Deno, browsers, etc.

- Is there only **one** or a handful of possible implementations, and does the
  community benefit from having a single, high-quality implementation vs. a choice
  of multiple individually-maintained implementations?

- Are there critical performance requirements or expectations, and can the
  organisation meet them?

- Is it possible the package could be maintained by the core Gleam organisation
  in the future? If so, would they benefit from

From time to time we may choose to maintain packages that don't fit these guidelines.
For example, we may choose to maintain a package that is only useful for a single
target if the value it provides is significant enough. For the most part, however,
the above guidelines will give you a good idea of what we're doing here.

## Can I contribute to a gleam-community package?

Yes, it's in our name! Our aim isn't to be a handful of "blessed" contributors:
we welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help. Opening issues, expanding
tests, or improving documentation are all great ways to contribute.

PRs are also welcome, but we ask that you open an issue first to discuss the change
you'd like to make.

## I have an idea for a package, what can I do?

We don't have a formal process for this yet, so the best way would be to ping one
of us on the Gleam [discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy) and we can discuss
it from there. Be mindful that we ask folks pitching ideas to make sure it roughly
fits the guidelines above and that they are **willing to maintain the package**
over the long-term.
